The Narragansett Bay Commission conducted a nine-month study (September 2020 to May 2021) to determine the average concentration (ng/L) of PFAS compounds in the influents, effluents, and filter cake/biosolid (ug/kg) at Fields Point and Bucklin Point facilities. Industries that were thought to be contributing PFAS compounds to both facilities were also sampled during the study period along with a few other specific point locations within the wastewater treatment facilities and blanks for Quality Control. Samples were sent to ESS, a contract lab, and analyzed for PFAS compounds using a modified EPA method 537.1.  PFAS concentrations in parts per trillion (ng/L=water, ug/kg=solid) were returned to the Narragansett Bay Commission for analysis.  Samples that were non-detectable by the lab were qualified as “U” in the dataset and samples that were under the reporting limits were qualified as “J”.  Only samples with a qualifier other than “U” and “J” were used to generate average concentrations for PFAS compounds. 

The raw code found in PFAS_script.R, if ran in Rstudio, will generate plots for average reportable concentrations for PFAS compounds in Fields Point influent, Effluent, and filter cake. The notes in the .R file will explain exactly what the code is doing. The code will also generate a plot for average reportable concentrations of PFAS compounds in industries discharging wastewater to Fields Point. 

This code will also generate plots for average reportable concentrations for PFAS compounds in Bucklin Point influent, Effluent, and filter cake.  The code will also generate a plot for average reportable concentrations of PFAS compounds in industries discharging wastewater to Bucklin Point.  

The reason both wastewater facilities are not analyzed/ graphed together is due to loading.  Fields point receives over 20 million gallons of water per day for treatment while Bucklin Point receives around 8 million gallons of water per day.  The average daily loads would have to be calculated in order to compare PFAS loads across the two wastewater facilities.
